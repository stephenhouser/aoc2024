# Day 03: Mull It Over

- Good chance to start using regex in C++

Looks like there are more instructions in the input text. Perhaps there is more to come with these input. In particular I see constructs like `then(mul(11,8)mul(8,5))` which might get complex.

Some examples:
    mul, then, do_not_mul, don't, undo
